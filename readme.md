# CardsAndDice
Oftentimes, when a person is trying to adapt a dice or card game into a program for playing it, they encounter the difficulties of 
1. Storing the game state as a file. 
2. Representing the game state in memory.
This library, written in portable C89, attempts to solve that problem, by providing ready-made ways of instantiating, storing, and loading the game state.
