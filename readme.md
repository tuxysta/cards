# Cards
Oftentimes, when a person is trying to adapt a card game into a program for playing it, they encounter the difficulties of 
1. Storing the game state as a file. 
2. Representing the game state in memory.

This library, written in portable C99, attempts to solve that problem, by providing ready-made structures for loading, storing, and manipulating decks of cards.
